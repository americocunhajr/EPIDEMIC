# EPIDEMIC - Epidemiology Educational Code

The EPIDEMIC is an easy-to-run educational Matlab toolkit for epidemiological analysis, which offers functionalities for modeling an epidemic, monitoring its progress and forecasting the underling numbers of interest. This code is, first of all, an educational tool for researchers and students who are interested in computational epidemiology. The programs and tutorials are designed to offer good introductory material for beginners in the field. But they can also be used to analyze epidemic data, as well as in the construction of some simplistic epidemic models.
