# EPIDEMIC - Epidemiology Educational Code

The EPIDEMIC is an easy-to-run educational Matlab toolkit for epidemiological analysis, which offers functionalities for modeling an epidemic, monitoring its progress and forecasting the underling numbers of interest. This code is, first of all, an educational tool for researchers and students who are interested in computational epidemiology. The programs and tutorials are designed to offer good introductory material for beginners in the field. But they can also be used to analyze epidemic data, as well as in the construction of some simplistic epidemic models. 

## Document organization
 
This document provides a description of all codes of EPIDEMIC. First the functions of the module Modeling are shown and then the codes of the compartmental models. After that, the code of the module Trends is described and finally, the code of the module Forecasts.

  ## Code of the module Forecasts
  
  ### epidemic_forecasts
  
  This is the main file to generate the forecast graphs of accumulated cases and accumulated deaths from an epidemic. The purpose of this algorithm is to present the number of cases and deaths over time, with a 5-day forecast ahead determined by linear regression on the logarithmic scale of the number of cases and deaths. The 95% confidence interval is also shown.                              
                                                                       
 Note: In order to forecast the next 5 days, the last 5 days are considered. You will need the 'cases-brazil-states.csv' file found in https://github.com/wcota/covid19br/

 cases-brazil-states.csv: wcota data file - .csv file
